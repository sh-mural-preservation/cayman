## Demands

1. Cease all mural painting-over until the stakeholders—including prospective new residents of 70 Amherst St, DSL and the [GSC Housing and Community Affairs committee (HCA)](https://goo.gl/PdWYKS)—determine how to ensure the safety of the art, and the readiness of the building for fall residents.
2. Follow the rules regarding mural modification or removal in [Part III (1). of the Mind and Hand Book](https://handbook.mit.edu/murals "MIT Residence Hall Mural Policies and Protocols"), especially the aspects enumerated after this list.
