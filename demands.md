## Demands

Before any more murals in 70 Amherst St are painted over, we seek the commitment of the administration toward the following:
1. Following the rules regarding mural modification or removal in [Part III (1). of the Mind and Hand Book](https://handbook.mit.edu/murals "MIT Residence Hall Mural Policies and Protocols"), especially the aspects enumerated after this list.
2. Setting up a committee with the authority to make decisions on the murals, including which to keep or to paint over, inviting representatives from the new residents, arts faculty, senior house historians, MIT Housing, and the GSC Housing and Community Affairs committee.
3. Permitting an open house of 70 Amherst St, inviting the entire MIT community to appreciate the murals and including them in the conversation.
