On July 7, 2017, after a year of administrative measures against the century-old undergraduate dorm [Senior House](https://goo.gl/CV2aPV), [Chancellor Cynthia Barnhart](https://goo.gl/ZRo6Dn) announced that the dorm would no longer house undergraduates; instead it would become a graduate residence now known as "70 Amherst St." As part of this reset, work began to paint over the murals in individual rooms of the dorm.

The walls, hallways, suites and rooms of Senior House are adorned with over 400 murals; these murals have considerable artistic, historical and cultural value, recognized by MIT with a Wiesner Student Art Award. They are a rare gift that has been decades in the making, to be inherited by the graduate students moving in. Senior House residents initiated a [documentation effort](https://goo.gl/4VbXzm) to capture every mural digitally, supported by MIT.

To pre-empt large-scale mural erasure, a [petition](petition-responses) was circulated on July 12, calling for a halt to any whitewashing until the heirs of the murals, namely the prospective new residents of 70 Amherst St, have had a chance to appreciate the murals and decide whether to keep them. The petition was physically submitted to MIT senior leadership **the very next day**, by which time it had already garnered 864 signatories, including 19 faculty members and 150 graduate students, including 29 prospective new residents. (See the [current numbers and breakdown of signatories](petition-responses).)

(What is the plan of the administration now??)
